 Basic    SLIP-39 Mnemonic creation                 
 Recover  Enhanced SLIP-39 creation and recovery    
 Pro      Conversion of BIP-39 Mnemonics to SLIP-39 


1 Basic
=======

  A basic SLIP-39 Mnemonic creation interface.


2 Recovery
==========

  Greater control over the Mnemonic creation process.  Recovery of Seed
  Entropy from SLIP-39 Mnemonics.


2.1 Extra Seed Randomness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Probably most importantly, Extra Seed Entropy can be supplied.  Any
  data supplied (Dice rolls, for example, add about 2.5 bits of entropy
  per roll) is hashed with a standard SHA-512 hash function, which can
  be independently confirmed.

  Finally, you can visually confirm that the Entropy is correctly
  applied via XOR to the Seed Data Source, to produce the Master Secret
  Seed.

  At no point do you need to "Trust" that the SLIP-39 program is
  producing a Master Secret Seed from known data!


2.2 SLIP-39
~~~~~~~~~~~

  Supports input of existing SLIP-39 mnemonics to recover the original
  Seed Entropy.


2.2.1 Recover From Lost SLIP-39 Mnemonic Cards
----------------------------------------------

  If you know that some of your original SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards have
  been lost, you can re-issue /another/ set of SLIP-39 cards containing
  the same, original Seed Entropy.


3 Pro
=====

  Advanced SLIP-39 creation and recovery, and recovery (and conversion)
  of BIP-39 Mnemonics to SLIP-39.

  Requires licensing.


3.1 BIP-39
~~~~~~~~~~

  Conversion of existing, fragile BIP-39 12- or 24-word Mnemonic phrases
  into SLIP-39 is supported.

  Enter the BIP-39 recover phrase to recover the original 128- or
  256-bit Seed Entropy, and generate SLIP-39 Mnemonics which will
  recover the same Seed Entropy as the original 12- or 24-word BIP-39
  Mnemonic.
